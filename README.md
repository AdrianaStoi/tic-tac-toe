Welcome to Tic Tac Toe ! 

Tic-tac-toe, known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a game designed for two players. They alternate turns to place their designated X or O marks within a 3x3 grid board game. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
Otherwise, when all cells on the grid are filled and no player has formed a winning line, nobody wins, it is a draw.
